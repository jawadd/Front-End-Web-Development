      Welcome to my personal website! My name is <strong>Jawad</strong> and I am
      a skilled developer with experience in a variety of technologies including
      Django, front-end development, Python, Git and GitHub, web scraping, and
      Google App Script. With a strong foundation in these areas, I am able to
      tackle a wide range of projects and challenges. Whether it's building
      dynamic web applications with Django, creating visually appealing
      front-end designs, or automating tasks with Google App Script, I am always
      striving to improve my skills and deliver high-quality work. Thank you for
      visiting my website and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any
      questions or opportunities for collaboration.
